# PubFlow-Jira-Plugin

The main part of the user interaction in [PubFlow] (http://www.pubflow.uni-kiel.de/en) is written as a Jira plugin.
The different issue types or workflows use the workflows given by the [Workflow Provider](https://github.com/PubFlow/Workflow-Provider)

To start the plugin the [config](https://github.com/PubFlow/PubFlow-Config) in the [Proploader](https://github.com/PubFlow/PubFlow-Jira-Plugin/blob/master/common/src/main/java/de/pubflow/common/PropLoader.java)
has to be set accordingly.
